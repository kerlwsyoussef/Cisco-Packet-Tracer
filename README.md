Network Configuration Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer)
This repository contains a collection of Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files, each representing a practical networking lab. These labs are designed to help students and professionals understand and configure fundamental and advanced networking concepts.

The labs cover a range of topics, from basic network services to complex routing and tunneling. Each file provides a complete network topology, and the final configurations are included for reference.

Labs Included
Workshop 2 VLAN Trunking.pkt
This lab focuses on the configuration of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and VLAN trunking. You will learn how to logically segment a single physical network into multiple broadcast domains and enable communication between switches using a trunk link.

Workshop 3 GRE tunneling complete.pkt
This file demonstrates how to set up a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel. This is a foundational lab for understanding how to securely connect two private networks over a public network, such as the internet.

Workshop 4 Logging.pkt
Explore the importance of network monitoring with this lab on Syslog logging. You will configure devices to send logging messages to a central server, which is crucial for troubleshooting and auditing network events.

Workshop 5 DHCP complete.pkt
Learn how to implement DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) on a network. This lab covers the configuration of a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses and other network parameters to client devices, simplifying network administration.

Workshop 6 Autonomous Systems complete.pkt
Dive into the world of inter-domain routing with this lab on Autonomous Systems. You will configure routing protocols, likely BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), to manage traffic flow between different autonomous systems.

Prerequisites
To open and interact with these files, you will need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer.
